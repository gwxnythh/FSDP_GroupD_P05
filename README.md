## Problem Statement
Digital Banking Accessible for Everyone

  As the capabilities of our digital channels grow to meet the needs of the consumers, most banking transactions can be carried out anytime, anywhere. However, for some customers, there may be barriers in their way.
  For example, a visually impaired person may not be able to see what is on the screen; a stroke recoveree may not have full use of their limbs to transact; a senior may not be digitally savvy to understand the interface.
